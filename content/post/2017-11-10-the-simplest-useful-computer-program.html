<p>You might have heard of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello, World!</a> program before, a very simple program whose only task is to print <em>Hello, World!</em>.</p>
<p>Being so simple, it is often used to show the syntax of a programming language, at least at a very basic level. On the other hand, being so “useless”, a complete newbie wouldn’t get a very concrete idea of a computer program and would even start questioning computer programming as a whole!</p>
<p>So, let’s try to write a program that exposes the fundamental building blocks of programming, being at the same time very simple and yet somehow useful.</p>
<div id="sequence" class="section level3">
<h3>Sequence</h3>
<p>The first idea to grasp is</p>
</div>
<div id="selection" class="section level3">
<h3>Selection</h3>
<p>Do something or something else based on a boolean value</p>
</div>
<div id="iteration" class="section level3">
<h3>Iteration</h3>
<p>As long as something is true, keep doing</p>
</div>

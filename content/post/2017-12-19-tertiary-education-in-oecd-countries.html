<p>I’ve read on multiple occasions that the fraction of the population with a tertiary degree in Italy is much lower than in other countries. I’ve always wondered how much this can be explained with the fact that, until relatively recently, Italy only had <strong>one</strong> type of academic degree.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/higher-education/bologna-process_en">Bologna process</a>, Italy reformed its academic degree system in 1999, introducing a three-year Bachelor’s and a two-year Master’s degree (<em>laurea triennale</em> and <em>laurea specialistica</em>). Before then, a single degree called <em>laurea</em>, with programs ranging from four to six years, was offered. I remember when, during my Erasmus in France, I would describe this to French students. Their reaction: “But then, if you want to quit after three years, you will have wasted time because you don’t have any degree!”</p>
<p>Since the old <em>laurea</em> is equivalent to the Master’s degree, those born before, approximately, 1981, either have a Master or nothing.</p>
<p>OECD makes available a table with the fraction of the population that has attained different levels of education (data from 2016). For tertiary education, this is split over Bachelor’s, Master’s, Short-cycle tertiary and Doctoral degrees.</p>

<p>The fraction of the population with a Master’s degree or equivalent in Italy is 13.7 %, exactly equivalent to the EU22 average and slightly higher than the OECD average (11.9%). Only 3.6% have a Bachelor’s, though, while the EU22 average is 13.2 %.</p>
<p>If we want to see the prevalence of tertiary degrees by age group, data are not split anymore by different types of degrees (at least, I haven’t found the data) and we only have a “tertiary education” indicator, displayed in the plot below.</p>

<p>Although the younger generations have doubled the earlier ones in achieving tertiary eduaction (but, remember, older ones could not choose to stop after a Bachelor), there is still a wide gap compared to OECD average.</p>

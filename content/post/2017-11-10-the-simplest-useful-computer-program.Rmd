You might have heard of the [Hello, World!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) program before.
A very simple program whose only task is to print _Hello, World!_. Being so simple, it is often used to show the syntax
of a programming language, at least at a very basic level. On the other hand, being so simple and "useless", it would
make a very weak case to explain to a complete newbie what is a computer program. Maybe it would
be probably impossible to convince them of the relevance of computer programming altogether!

So, let's try to write a program that exposes the fundamental building blocks of programming, is very simple and yet a
bit useful.

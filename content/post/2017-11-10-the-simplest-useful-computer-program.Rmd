a very simple program whose only task is to print _Hello, World!_.

Being so simple, it is often used to show the syntax
of a programming language, at least at a very basic level. On the other hand, being so "useless", a complete newbie
wouldn't get a very concrete idea of a computer program and would even start questioning computer programming as a whole!

So, let's try to write a program that exposes the fundamental building blocks of programming, being at the same time

### Sequence

The first idea to grasp is 

### Selection

Do something or something else based on a boolean value

### Iteration

As long as something is true, keep doing

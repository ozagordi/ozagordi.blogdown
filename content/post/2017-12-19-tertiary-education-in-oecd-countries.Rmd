I've read on multiple occasions that the fraction of the population with a tertiary degree in Italy is
much lower than in other countries. I've always wondered how much this can be explained with the fact
that, until relatively recently, Italy only had **one** type of academic degree.

As a consequence of
the [Bologna process](http://ec.europa.eu/education/policy/higher-education/bologna-process_en),
Italy reformed its academic degree system in 1999, introducing a three-year Bachelor's and
a two-year Master's degree (_laurea triennale_ and _laurea specialistica_). Before then, a single
degree called _laurea_, with programs ranging from four to six years, was offered. I remember when,
during my Erasmus in France, I would describe this to French students. Their reaction: "But then,
if you want to quit after three years, you will have wasted time because you don't have any degree!"

Since the old _laurea_ is equivalent to the Master's degree, those born before, approximately, 1981,
either have a Master or nothing.

OECD makes available a table with the fraction of the population that
has attained different levels of education (data from 2016). For tertiary education, this is split
over Bachelor's, Master's, Short-cycle tertiary and Doctoral degrees.

```{r main_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(plotly)
library(widgetframe)

cpalette <- c('#bdc9e1', '#74a9cf', '#2b8cbe', '#045a8d')
all_data <- read.csv("tables/education_oecd.csv", sep = ",")
edu <- all_data %>%
  filter(ISC11A %in% c('L5', 'L6', 'L7', 'L8'),
         Measure == 'Value',
         Reference.year == 'Latest available year',
         SEX == 'T') %>%
  select(country_code, ISC11A, Value) %>%
  group_by(country_code) %>%
  spread(ISC11A, Value) %>%
  mutate(L5 = ifelse(is.na(L5), 0.0, round(L5, 1))) %>%
  mutate(L6 = ifelse(is.na(L6), 0.0, round(L6, 1))) %>%
  mutate(L7 = ifelse(is.na(L7), 0.0, round(L7, 1))) %>%
  mutate(L8 = ifelse(is.na(L8), 0.0, round(L8, 1))) %>%
  arrange(desc(L7))
edu$country_code <- factor(edu$country_code, levels = edu$country_code)

p <- plot_ly(edu, x = ~country_code, y = ~L7, type = 'bar', name = "Master's",
             marker = list(color = cpalette[4])) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~L8, name = "Doctoral", marker = list(color = cpalette[3])) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~L6, name = "Bachelor's", marker = list(color = cpalette[2])) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~L5, name = "Short-cycle", marker = list(color = cpalette[1])) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = '', tickangle = -90)) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'percentage of population aged 25-64 (2016)'), barmode = 'stack')
frameWidget(p)
```

The fraction of the population with a Master's degree or equivalent in Italy is 13.7 %, exactly
equivalent to the EU22 average and slightly higher than the OECD average (11.9%). Only 3.6% have a
Bachelor's, though, while the EU22 average is 13.2 %.

If we want to see the prevalence of tertiary degrees by age group, data are not split anymore by
different types of degrees (at least, I haven't found the data) and we only have a
"tertiary education" indicator, displayed in the plot below.

```{r second_plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(plotly)
library(widgetframe)

age_groups <- c("55-64", "45-54", "35-44", "25-34")
Italy <- c(12.4, 14.0, 20.5, 25.6)
OECD <- c(26.5, 32.1, 40.5, 43.1)
data <- data.frame(age_groups, Italy, OECD)
xaxis <- list(title = "age group")
p <- plot_ly(data, x = ~age_groups, y = ~Italy, type = 'bar', name = 'Italy',
             marker = list(color = '#bdc9e1')) %>%
  add_trace(y = ~OECD, name = 'OECD', marker = list(color = '#74a9cf')) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = '')) %>%
  layout(yaxis = list(title = 'percentage in same age group (2016)'), barmode = 'group') %>%
layout(title = "Tertiary education by age group")
frameWidget(p)
```

Although the younger generations have doubled the earlier ones in achieving tertiary eduaction (but,
remember, older ones could not choose to stop after a Bachelor), there is still a wide gap compared
to OECD average.

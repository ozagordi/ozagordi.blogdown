<p><em>Attention conservation notice:</em> a few hundred words on something that could have been summarized in just the figure plus a number (in other words, a tweet).</p>
<div id="background" class="section level4">
<h4>Background</h4>
<p>Very recently, this image appeared on my Linkedin feed, posted by a former colleague of mine (the caption is
taken from the file name).</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/img/Temperature-change-and-carbon-dioxide-change-measured-from-the-EPICA-Dome-C-ice-core-in-Antarctica-v2.jpg" alt="Temperature change and carbon dioxide change measured from the EPICA Dome C ice core in Antarctica" />
<p class="caption">Temperature change and carbon dioxide change measured from the EPICA Dome C ice core in Antarctica</p>
</div>
<p>With just a few words to accompany it, the point being that one has to look at the right time scale to
gain perspective, the interpretation was left to the reader.</p>
<p>So, if the world, as it seems, has already experienced an increase in both CO2 and temperature levels
over the hundreds of thousands of years, why bother?</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/Temperature-change-and-carbon-dioxide-change-measured-from-the-EPICA-Dome-C-ice-core-in-Antarctica-v2.jpg">link</a>
is authentic. The image is really hosted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, scientific
agency of the US government. EPICA is (was) a big European project to drill ice core in Antarctica and
study climate in the past.</p>
<p>A reverse image search finds the image <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/global-warming/temperature-change">here</a>.
Nothing suspicious.</p>

<h4>…right?</h4>
<p>Except that, the current CO2 concentration is not below 300 ppm as the figure would imply.
It went above this level already in the 50’s, and it is now over 410 ppm (412, as of today), and
<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/">rising</a> (from the NASA website, data from NOAA).</p>
<p>So, whoever wants to make the point that it’s not so bad after all, should at least keep in mind that
the very last part of that graph has been cut. At least.</p>
